# MODERN MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS APPLIED TO FUTURE PROTON COLLIDER DATA ANALYSES

Please find within this depository the Jupyter notebooks used in the analysis of the MPhys project.

The sparticles python package used to load the data from generated .h5 files can be found at https://github.com/jd550179/FCCHBBTAUTAU

## General

**InputVariables.ipynb** was used to generate the input variable plots.

**FeaturesFromkFoldScore.ipynb** was used to generate the score threshold plots.

## 84 TeV
**GATModel_CarlFold_84TeV.ipynb** was used to generate the significances in the main section of the Results.

**mHH_star_84TeV.ipynb** was used to generate the cuts on the m*_HH value.

## 100 TeV
**GATModel_Carl.ipynb** was used to generate the significances for 100 TeV.
